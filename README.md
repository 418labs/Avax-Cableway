# Avax-Cableway: Relayer as a Service

Deploy and manage your relayers on Avalanche with just one click!

We believe that the future of the Avalanche ecosystem is in the interoperability of the different blockchains of the ecosystem.
We are building a platform that allows users to deploy their own relayers and
manage them easily.

We also envision a future where the relayers will be able to choose the messages that will generate profit, and the user will be able to
choose the relayer that will be the most profitable for them.

This project is a proof of concept (that works!) started with <3 in the
[Summit LATAM Hackathon 2024](https://academy.avax.network/hackathon).

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
